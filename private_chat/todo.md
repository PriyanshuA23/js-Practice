# Goal

- I want a mechanism to talk to any particular person who are registered in the
  place and can send any message to anyone who all are registered in that
  server.

# idea for private chat

- If two people are connected to a server they can message to each other.

```
person1     -->         [Server]            -->     person2
            <--    (check whom to send)     <--
```
